        <p>There’s no time like the present. Especially if you are in the video surveillance business. In addition to 4,000 CCTV cameras already in place, Delhi is set to get 10,000 more cameras at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,225 crores, to make the city safer for women. Are these costs justified? As CCTV cameras become common fixtures in public and privately owned spaces alike, there is a sense that they surely bring some new information that could be valuable. </p>
        <p>A steady stream of criticism about the effectiveness of CCTV cameras in tackling crimes has done nothing to dampen its proliferation. We looked at the use of CCTV cameras in garments manufacturing factories in Bangalore, where women constitute more than 80% of the workforce, to see in what ways CCTV cameras have changed the space.</p>
        <h5 class='center bold' id='thoughts-on-cc'>Thoughts on ‘CC cameras’</h5>
        <p>Opinions on ‘CC cameras’, a common way of referring to closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras amongst garment factory workers, were quite mixed. </p>
        <p>Girija, who has worked in different garment factories for the last 17 years, defended CCTV cameras staunchly. She advanced several ways in which they are beneficial for women working in factories:</p>
        <p></p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote>
        <p class='quote'>CC cameras are good and should be there in all factories. Women also benefit from it sometimes. There is theft, teasing, harassment during which CC cameras come of use.</p>
        <p class='quote'>Lots of women sneak in mobile phones and constantly want to talk. How can you work if you talk so much? It is not only for emergency that they talk! Sometimes they go to the bathroom and talk to boys and then get raped. With CC cameras, these things reduce.</p>
        <p class='quote'>To go out, you need a permission slip. If something goes wrong while the women take permission slip and step out, then factories are blamed for it. So factories are correct in taking measures.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>Girija’s views on CCTV cameras are reminiscent of CCTV evangelism that is common in the news about women’s safety: seeking to tackle multiple kinds of problems, with a large helping of moral panic (PTI 2015). </p>
        <p>For Meenu, a migrant worker from Orissa, who was distressed about a post-dated cheque she had received as payment, CCTV cameras were not high on her list of complaints.</p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>Cameras are there. I think it is used to see if we are working properly.</p></blockquote>
        <p class='quote'>Upon prodding, she admits that the cameras don’t strike her as exacting - just necessary. A lot of literature on workplace surveillance, too, takes as its starting point that organisations and surveillance go hand in hand (Ball 2003, 2010).  </p>
        <p class='quote'>Still others, like Gowri, a factory worker from the Peenya area, was confident that CCTV cameras are yet another tool of control in the factory. However, she made sure to qualify her remarks to say that it was beneficial to have such cameras elsewhere, like in public places.</p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>CC cameras are good in schools or on the road or in hospitals. But in the factory, it is torture. Even at the main gate it makes sense - so that they can check if anybody is stealing things. But on the floor in the batches, it becomes very hard for us to talk. If we want to talk about work related things like the union also it is hard.</p></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>This is unsurprising, as surveillance is usually multi-purposed and comes with a range of opportunities and disadvantages, which is why it is challenging to either support or reject it wholesale (Rosenblat &amp; Kleese &amp; boyd 2014, p. 9).</p>
        <p>It was clear from the get-go that among garment factory workers, the experiences of surveillance through CCTV cameras were quite subjective, but the idea of safety through surveillance had gained a foothold in varying degrees. Even then, why did some workers have concerns?</p>
        <h5 class='center bold' id='speculative-uses'>Speculative uses</h5>
        <p>None of the workers remember any advisory or justifications being given before CCTV cameras were installed in their factories. The workers held no expectations of such communication from their employers either. ‘Why do they have to give us reasons? No reasons were given’, said Gowri. Over time, CCTV cameras have become normalised in factory environments. Anusha, a second-generation garments worker said ‘It was there before I joined. Cameras were there in the old factory I worked at also.’</p>
        <p>When asked if Rupa can hazard a guess why CCTV cameras were installed, she offers a reason that came up repeatedly in conversations with workers across factories.  </p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>What is the use for us of CC cameras? It has been there for 5 years, since 5 years no one has given a reason. We have heard from others that it is due to theft. Of course the company will want it, it is very useful for them to instill fear in us.</p></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>Some estimates from the workers about when CCTV cameras were first installed date back to 2008, following the suicide of Ammu, a garment worker who killed herself in a factory bathroom, on account of unbearable persecution from her supervisor, according to the suicide note in her palm (Ratnam 2007). In the absence of official communication about the intention of installing CCTV cameras, workers speculated that CCTV cameras were one of the measures taken by the factories, to be seen as doing something in response to widespread protests about deplorable working conditions and increasing factory-related deaths (there were 3 in 2007 alone).</p>
        <p>The other reason workers thought CCTV cameras have been installed is to address issues of sexual harassment and safety.</p>
        <h5 class='center bold' id='measures'>Measures to tackle sexual harassment include CCTV cameras</h5>
        <p>The extent of sexual harassment in garment factories is detailed in a June, 2016 report by Sisters for Change and Munnade.</p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>Perpetrators of sexual harassment, because of their supervisory and management roles, have significant power over women workers (with the ability to terminate employment or stop wage payments) and enjoy widespread impunity. 61% of garment workers surveyed indicated that they had been silenced and prevented from reporting cases of sexual harassment and violence by the threats made by perpetrators. And over 1 in 7 women workers said they had left their job due to harassment or violence.</p></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>After a lot of pressure on global brands from labour unions and rights groups, to keep a tab on basic working conditions in their supply chains, multi-stakeholder roundtables that meet periodically have been constituted to tackle sexual harassment. In these fora, CCTV cameras have often been brought up as one of the measures taken to tackle the problem of widespread sexual harassment in factories, says Usha, a labour union activist we spoke to.</p>
        <p>While several workers had bought into the safety discourse around CCTV cameras, they were unable to think of any instance where footage from the cameras has been useful for the workers in seeking redressal for specific issues. </p>
        <p>Contrary to popular imagination, CCTV cameras have at times been detrimental to fights against sexual harassment, points out Usha, one of the union leaders. </p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>A complaint of repeated sexual harassment by the supervisor was not taken seriously, thanks to CCTV cameras. The supervisor would come and say lewd things to the worker on the factory floor and provoke her in all kinds of ways, but because the cameras are not able to capture the sound of his words, the exchange did not appear out of the ordinary, and the complaint was dismissed. </p></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>Erasure of verbal forms of sexual harassment is a pattern that has been noticed in the context of video surveillance elsewhere too (Koskela 2000, 2002). Such an erasure of verbal sexual harassment is a reminder that whether CCTV cameras are beneficial or detrimental, is determined by details like who has ownership over the device and data, who has information about its operational details and who gets to mobilise it.</p>
        <p>Claims that CCTV cameras are setup to also aid workers in reducing workplace and sexual harassment holds no water if control over the systems lies squarely with the management. Perhaps, this is why some workers were reminded of their phones as more reliable tools in holding supervisors and others accountable for harassment.</p>
        <p>Safety discourses and restrictions can be hard to tell apart. From warnings against wearing ‘revealing’ clothes to exchanging intimate photographs, safety is primarily constructed as a prize for following rules and restrictions, anywhere one looks. This is best articulated by the movement against restrictive hostel rules for women in Delhi University, called Pinjra Tod. In an interview, a member of the collective talks about how CCTV cameras in her paying guest (PG) accommodation were instruments for moral policing.</p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>In my PG we had CCTV cameras to record our movements, entry and exit timings, rules to not wear short clothes, take wardens written permission to go out or stay out at night, parents approval for trivial things and constantly proving our ‘good girl’ reputation to maintain the elitist image of these accommodation (Malu 2016).</p></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>CCTV cameras are popular solutions for those forging ‘women’s safety’ agendas. But it can come at great cost to women’s movements and privacy. </p>
        <p>There are instances of extreme forms of violence against women that have taken place in the workplace in the presence of CCTV cameras. In a recent case involving the rape of an employee of a popular IT firm, company officials were quoted as saying they were ‘flabbergasted’ because the incident occurred despite the fact that the company has an emergency safety app, ‘panic buttons’ on all buses and cabs and CCTV cameras on its premises. </p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>Yesterday’s unfortunate incident is a reminder however that nothing is foolproof, and we are continuing to seek recommendations and suggestions from different stakeholders on how we can try and strengthen the safety of our employees...” read the official statement from the company, whose security personnel was the perpetrator (Express News Service 2017).</p></blockquote>
        <p>A new amendment in the Factories Act 1948 by the Karnataka State government enables women to work night shifts from January 2017- something that was not possible until now unless you worked in IT or ITES sectors (Express News Service 2016). The amendment is a welcome change for women in manufacturing and service sectors who wish to earn more. Such a move is accompanied naturally by a demand for safety measures to also be put in place. Union leaders are apprehensive that this juncture will be yet another instance where the management puts in place restrictions in the name of safety, without actually enhancing safety of women employees. <sup><a>[a]</a></sup></p>
        <h5 class='center bold' id='threats'>New threats join old ones</h5>
        <p>There are plenty of cases where CCTV cameras have enabled new forms of harassment and avenues of voyeurism. Aruna, who heads an NGO that works with garment workers, recalls an incident where a supervisor would ask a worker to come half an hour earlier than working hours, in order to solicit sexual favours. The supervisor would do so emboldened by the knowledge that CCTV cameras would be turned on only at the start of the work hours.</p>
        <p>This illustrates two points. First, ‘displacement effect’: studies on CCTV surveillance have shown that CCTV cameras simply displace criminal activity to areas that are not being watched (Brantingham and Brantingham 1981). This effect has been demonstrated in studies on public surveillance systems where spatial displacements of crime occur, but it is equally relevant to understand the case in point, where a temporal displacement has occurred. Second, the role of the supervisor as a ‘power broker’. The supervisor’s job is also surveilled by the management, but his operational knowledge of video surveillance deployment in the factory enables him to subvert evidence gathering of his misconduct.</p>
        <p>Most recently, a probe by the Delhi Commission for Women, which is evangelical in installing CCTV cameras for women’s safety, found that CCTV cameras in the government-run home for the mentally disabled were being used to watch women inmates in the bathroom hallway while they lined up for baths (The Wire Staff 2017).</p>
        <p>5. What do companies do with CCTV cameras?</p>
        <p>Workers have faced consequences for being caught on camera doing things unpalatable to the management.</p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>Me and my friend were called to the GM room for laughing. He saw it in the CC camera. They cut Rs. 5 for the day from our payment of Rs. 20. It was the first time something happened to me personally. Now we are scared to do anything - not even talk. We cannot rest also.</p></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>Through such one-off instances and from supervisors’ threats, workers are aware that the monitors are located in the General Manager’s room. But as workers were never formally informed about the purpose(s) the CCTV cameras would serve, supervisors and managers use the camera to warn again stealing, just as well as to warn against wasting time. Without a purpose limitation, the ‘function creep’ of the technology enables its use in more insidious ways than what might have initially been intended.<sup><a>[b]</a></sup> </p>
        <p>CCTV cameras also end up making normal, private actions prone to watchfulness, leading to discomfort for women workers.</p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>Sometimes we scratch inside our blouses forgetting that there is a camera watching and suddenly it becomes very weird. Nowadays I try to ignore any itch.</p></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>Technologies like CCTV cameras are cheaper than ever, and present an opportunity to increase efficiency and intrusiveness of monitoring. </p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>They monitor how much time we are in the bathroom. There are watchmen near the bathroom and if we are there for too long in the stall, they will knock. We go there to use our phones but sometimes we get caught. Going to bathroom is monitored from the cameras also.</p></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>Paul Atwell (1987) argues that when an organisation is competing in a mature product market with mature technologies and competing on the basis of price and producing high quantities of similar goods, there is more of an incentive for it to keep a close eye on resource use and employee activity. Similarly, if there is an abundant supply of labor and low unionisation, close monitoring is likely to meet with less opposition and resistance (Ball 2010). At 3% unionisation, these are all factors that are true of the Indian export garments manufacturing industry.</p>
        <p>There is the recognition among some workers that without access to footage and a say in the operation of the cameras, any reason given for large-scale deployment will not accrue benefits to them.</p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>Only if we are shown the camera will it be useful for us. Even if there is something useful for us, they are capable of deleting it and keeping only what is good for them. If supervisor scolds or tortures or harasses it can be useful. But we have not used it so far. We have used our phones to record videos and use that. That is probably why they don’t like us keeping phones inside.</p></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>Mobile phones have been proven to be very powerful in the hands of workers. <sup><a>[c]</a></sup>Many factories require workers to leave mobile phones behind in the lockers before getting to work, although it is common practice for women to sneak it in by putting it in their blouses, as they can be fairly certain that the management would stop short of checking there. One of the purposes the phone can serve, is what CCTV cameras do for the management: help in capturing evidence against the other party. </p>
        <p>CCTV cameras are not undesirable, by definition. As stressed in earlier sections, power relations need to be examined to assess the value to any technology.<sup><a>[d]</a></sup></p>
        <p>CCTV cameras are used to crackdown on workers who are vocal and and protest against unfair conduct. Hema, a new member of the union, but a long-time ‘loudmouth’ by her own admission, faced punitive action for standing up for her friend when the supervisor spoke to the latter brashly for not being able to show up for ‘overtime’ (OT) work. Curiously, the punishment (as well as deterrent) for her behaviour was to occupy a place on the shopfloor where CCTV cameras could demonstrably focus on her. She admits that this has indeed impacted her morale.</p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>I feel really bad that no one talks to me. I am asked to sit far away from the others. They turn the cameras to point at me so that they can keep me under observation and make sure that I don’t have anybody to talk to. </p></blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <p>It is very common for women who talk back in factories to be vindictively targeted with surveillance cameras, and isolate them from their co-workers, says Malathi, a labour union activist and former garments worker. Such ways of using CCTV cameras hurts workers’ civil liberties, affecting their freedom of association.</p>
        <p>In April 2016, workers protested against an amendment to the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, which would bring a host of restrictions for withdrawal from employees’ Provident Fund. The police cooperated with the factory management to use public CCTV cameras to identify protesters from each factory. Data from surveillance cameras installed at traffic signals by the government were shared with factory owners to zero down on ‘troublemakers’. A fact finding report by the Karnataka People’s Union for Civil Liberties and Women Against Sexual Violence and State Repression- Karnataka confirms that CCTV footage was used in making arrests.</p>
        <p>This is a shocking instance of the police being in cohorts with big capital, and using public CCTV cameras to undermine civil and political rights of workers. Ever since that incident, workers do not linger around outside the gates, says Malathi.</p>
        <h5 class='center bold' id='access-to-data'>Access to data (Power and control)</h5>
        <p>The work culture in garments factories is such that employees are encouraged informally and by way of policies, to keep a check on their colleagues. For example, in one factory, workers are divided into groups, and if in a group of 50 workers, if 3 take a day off in a month, then the attendance bonus for all workers in the group gets cancelled. Workers are incentivised to keep each other answerable in such ways. The pressure to not take a day off is not only for their own attendance bonus, but also carry the responsibility of everybody else’s. Surveillance is not only carried out through new technologies, but through social burdens of shared penalties.</p>
        <p>The focus group discussions were conducted within a safe space, where the workers were willing to speak frankly about the issues they faced. Even when approached near the streets leading to their factories at the end of the work day, or in public view during street plays, workers were happy to open up about their opinions on CCTV cameras. However, presence of co-workers during the conversation meant that their views would turn agreeable with the management, even if it contradicted what they were saying minutes before, prior to the co-worker joining us. This was perhaps due to fear of being identified and facing retribution from the management. </p>
        <p>Kirstie Ball (2010) highlights how organisations now use a raft of surveillance techniques that are embedded not only within specific tools, but also within the social processes of managing. She says that surveillance in the workplace not only produces measurable outcomes in terms of targets met or service levels delivered, but also produces particular cultures which regulate performance, behaviours and personal characteristics in a more subtle way.</p>
        <p>The ability of CCTVs to deter crimes has been questioned time and again. V<sup><a>[e]</a></sup>ideo surveillance does the job of ‘security theater’ more than that of security. One worker notes that it is not as if thefts have completely stopped. A raid by the factory owner into a worker’s house revealed about 400 pieces of sleeves having been stolen over a period of time. It wasn’t surveillance cameras that helped catch the worker, but a tip-off from a co-worker.</p>
        <p>When asked if there has been a marked change in working conditions since CCTVs were installed, the workers lament that they have become more afraid that they will be caught for minor infringements more easily. The efficiency of watching everyone, as well as the promise of efficiency is threatening.</p>
        <a></a><a></a><blockquote><p class='quote'>They could not catch us for small things before. Now they can see lots of us at once. We never know when they are watching. Things have definitely changed. We are so scared that we don’t even try to relax. There are times people get caught so we know that we are being watched. GM could not have watched so well without it.</p></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>New technologies deployed by employers in exploitative industries does not get the kind of attention from grassroot labour rights movements that it deserves. The formative potential of surveillance technologies have real impacts on human rights and the dignity of labour in workplaces. The National People’s Tribunal for living wages and decent working conditions of garment workers, was held in its third edition in 2011. One of the recommendations made to the jury was to consider the effects of the practice of affixing CCTV cameras to monitor workers in factories. This recommendation was not included in the final jury verdict (Clean Clothes Campaign 2012).<sup><a>[f]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Lack of specific policy formulation by the employer about the use of CCTV cameras makes it hard to locate and question legitimacies of the technology. It also leaves no room for distribution of gains from the surveillance between employers and employees. Asymmetries of power are further exacerbated due to the limited technical understanding of the consequences of the use of CCTV cameras by the workers, and the drastically higher monetary and knowledge capital at the disposal of the employer.</p>
        <p>Without enough attention given to the control over devices and the data, technologies like CCTV cameras get normalised without a chance for the surveilled asserting agency over them.</p>

      </h5>
      <p>
        Since 2010, a number of khap panchayats across north India have pronounced bans on mobile phone use for young women. What drives such orders? Are they really effective?
